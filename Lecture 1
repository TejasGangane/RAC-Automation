Time constraints and complexity. How a good coder tries to solve a problem and reduce the time of execution. Also how to approach a problem from Brute Force to a most efficient solution.

Time Complexity for Linear Equation: k^n â€¦. where n is the order of equation.

Time Complexity for Quadratic Equation: log(n)
