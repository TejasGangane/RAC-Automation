 # RAC-Automation
Repository Contains my personal notes and problems with solutions on AI-ML and Python.

It is a domain where you write code to automate tasks via AI-ML. It has a vast application in the near future and helps you in learning complex things. The essential prerequisites are Python, NumPy, and Pandas.

# Lecture 1 :

Time constraints and complexity. How a good coder tries to solve a problem and reduce the time of execution. Also how to approach a problem from Brute Force to a most efficient solution.

Time Complexity for Linear Equation: k^n â€¦. where n is the order of equation.

Time Complexity for Quadratic Equation: log(n)
